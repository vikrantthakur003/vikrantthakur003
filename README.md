# 👋 Hi there, I'm Vikrant!

I'm a **Full Stack Engineer** from 🇮🇳 India with 1+ year of experience.  
I love building clean, user-friendly web apps using **JavaScript**, **React**, and the **MERN stack**.

Currently, I'm working at a fast-growing startup, where I turn ideas into working products.  
I'm always curious to learn new tech and exploring **AWS** and **Cloud** stuff these days ☁️💻.
